PCB submission instructions
===========================

**Submission deadline: 9am Monday 3 April 2016**

   anything else**) into this directory.

2. Rename them to `camera.PcbDoc`, `comms.PcbDoc`, and `motor.PcbDoc`.

3. Make sure there is at least one person for each PCB who has added contact
   details to the `submissions/contacts.txt` file.

4. Commit the files and push them to the server by 9am Monday 4 April.

5. Check out a fresh copy, open the submitted PCBs in Altium, and double-check
